# Cisco Switch Image Extraction

## From PDF: "Switches - Catalyst 9000_Art.pdf"

### Images to Extract:

**Page 2 - C9200L-24T-4G Front**
- Save as: `switches/cisco-c9200l-24t-4g.png`
- 24-port Gigabit switch (1U)

**Page 3 - C9200L-48P-4G Front** 
- Save as: `switches/cisco-c9200l-48p-4g.png`
- 48-port PoE+ switch (1U)

### Extraction Steps:
1. Open the PDF in a graphics program or PDF viewer
2. Select/copy each switch image
3. Save as high-resolution PNG with transparent background
4. Ensure front view perspective only
5. Crop to include just the switch body (no extra whitespace)

### Image Requirements:
- Format: PNG (transparent background preferred)
- Resolution: High quality (300+ DPI)
- Perspective: Front view only
- Content: Switch body without mounting ears (consistent with our approach)
